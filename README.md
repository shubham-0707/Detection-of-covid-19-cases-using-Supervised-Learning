# Detection-of-covid-19-cases-using-Supervised-Learning
- In this project I have downloaded a publicly available data from Kaggle website.
- And then the data is cleaned and checked for null values
- Then data is checked for duplicate values and then duplicate values are removed.
- Then the data is divided into four parts i.e. x_train ,y_train , x-test , y_test using sk_learn library.
- And then using Logistic Regression the model is trained.
- Then the accuracy is checked and the accuracy was way less than the desired.
- To increase the accuracy I have used RandomForestClassifier to train the model.
- And after using the RandomForestClassifier the model was trained using the XGBoost Classifier.
- At last the final accuracy score of the model wad 91.59% which is a decent score but not best.
- This model is working fine in detecting the probability of covid-19 test result based on the symptoms provided and gender provided.
- If anyone wants to work on this project or do correction in this model you are most welcome.
